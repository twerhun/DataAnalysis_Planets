# DataAnalysis_Planets

If you ever wondered if Star Wars planets could exist in our universe - here you may find the answer.

The goal of this project is to gather data about planets from Star Wars universe and our real life exoplanets, compare them and create an algorithm which will determine which exoplanet is the most similar to chosen Star Wars planet.
This project is devided into 3 parts:

Part 1. Creating two data sets (StarWarsPlanets and Exoplanets) using data scraping technique - data was collected from wiki pages (wikipedia for exoplanets, wookieepedia for Star Wars planets) using BeautifulSoup python library. Converting data to dataframe format, intial cleaning and exporting as csv files.

Part 2. Data cleaning. Extracting numerical values and their units, standardizing data to chosen base units. Exporting cleaned frames as csv files.

Part 3. Creating algorithm that will compare two prepared data sets, finding elements that are closest to each other. Conducting Data Analysis of chosen aspects of created data sets.
