# DataAnalysis_Planets

If you ever wondered if Star Wars planets could exist in our universe - here you may find the answer.

The goal of this project is to gather data about planets from Star Wars universe and our real life exoplanets, compare them and create an algorythm which will determine which exoplanet is the most similar to chosen Star Wars planet.
In this part I created two data sets (StarWarsPlanets and Exoplanets) using data scraping technique - data was collected from wiki pages (wikipedia for exoplanets, wookieepedia for Star Wars planets) using BeautifulSoup python library.
Collected data was transformed into data frames using pandas library, and after initial cleaning saved as csv files.

Created csv files will be used in Part 2 of the project.
